  // Replace placeholders

  await sendEmail({
    from: 'info@melitechsolutions.co.ke',
    to: clientEmail,
    subject: `Invoice ${invoiceData.invoiceNumber} & Receipt ${receiptData.receiptNumber} - Payment Received`,
    html: emailContent,
    attachments: [
      {
        filename: `${invoiceData.invoiceNumber}.pdf`,
        content: invoicePDF
      },
      {
        filename: `${receiptData.receiptNumber}.pdf`,
        content: receiptPDF
      }
    ]
  });
  
  return { success: true };
}
```

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com', // or your SMTP server
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
    pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD
  }
});

## Email Variations

### For Invoice Only (No Payment Yet)

**Subject:** Invoice INV-2024-001 from Melitech Solutions

Change the opening to:
> "Thank you for your business! Please find attached your invoice for the services provided."

Remove the receipt-related content and payment confirmation.

### For Receipt Only (Payment Confirmation)

**Subject:** Payment Receipt REC-00001 - Thank You!

Focus on payment confirmation:
> "Thank you for your payment! We have successfully received your payment of KES 1,102,000."

### For Overdue Invoice Reminder

**Subject:** Reminder: Invoice INV-2024-001 Due Soon

Add urgency:
> "This is a friendly reminder that Invoice INV-2024-001 is due on [DUE_DATE]. Please arrange payment at your earliest convenience."
